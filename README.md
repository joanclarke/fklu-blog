# Faith Keeps Looking Up ✨

**Faith Keeps Looking Up** is a personal blog project being built alongside my fullstack development journey. It will evolve as I learn — integrating real features only after I master the skills needed to build them.

This repo is part of my **Evolution Path to a Future-Proof Developer** curriculum. The goal is to build a clean, secure, and interactive fullstack application that includes:

- ✅ Page routing with React Router
- 🔄 Verse of the Day (Bible API integration)
- 📬 Contact form (frontend and backend)
- 🔐 Prayer journal with user auth
- ☁️ Deployment with Vercel/Render
- 🧠 Optional AI-enhanced features later

> 💡 This is a _learning-first_ build — styling, polish, and advanced features will come after logic and structure are in place.

## 🚀 Current Progress

✔ Base React + Vite project set up  
✔ Static routing for: Home, About, Contact, Blog  
🆕 Added Verse of the Day component to Home page using Bible API.
🛠 Styling, components, and dynamic features coming in future commits

## 📌 Developer Notes

This project is being tracked in a dedicated roadmap here:  
**Evolution Path HQ** (managed with ChatGPT)

Each feature is unlocked and implemented **only after** the related skill is learned.
